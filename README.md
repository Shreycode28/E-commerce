Milestone 4: Project Overview -

In this milestone we learned

User Model: I created a User Model, which defines how user data (like name, email, and password) will be structured in the database using MongoDB. This model acts as a blueprint, ensuring data consistency and organization.

User Controller: I created a User Controller to manage interactions with the user data, such as handling sign-up requests, saving user data to the database, and responding to user actions. The controller acts like a manager, overseeing what happens when users interact with the app.

Multer for File Uploads: I enabled Multer, a tool that facilitates file uploads (like profile pictures) by managing and storing the uploaded files on the server. It helps keep track of user files in the backend.
